The way I developed the code was taking it off an instructable, studying it and breaking it down and making edits I felt were needed based on the initial difficulty of the game.
An insight I had was that while playing I noticed that it was far too easy to win so I had to change the timing for the LEDs so it presented a bigger challenge.
I did not recognize any patterns except for the consant use of delays throughout the code.
