Batteries will likely be delayed.... I had to create a new project as opposed to my old one because the previous one proved too complicated. I attempted making it several times and
each time it failed to work.
Due to that you probably already know my project does NOT reflect a month's worth of work *annoys me* as I am trying something else. I am going to create my code for it today and come
in after school on Wednesday so I can finish it in time and make sure it is of acceptable
quality.
I should have not done tic tac toe in the first place, but it looked quite simple initially until I started getting into it. Wish I had done my current idea from the start which is far
simpler.
I may not have time for PCB, but I will try to make some for it. Perhaps I could bring my project home on Wednesday and solder it there.
