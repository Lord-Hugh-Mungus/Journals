Why would we create checkbounds() to accept different shapes?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We would create checkbounds() to accept different shapes so we can check the bounds of something beyond pacman
which allows us to use one set of code for collisions instead of creating code for each shape we want
to check collisions on such as Ghosts.

Explain how to make ghosts move. Provide code for:
Using a for loop in conjunction with an ArrayList to make ghosts move with the method move()
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Actually, I have a different way of creating ghosts as I want to get as close to the original pacman game as I can, as such I will
describe how I plan to do this some psuedo code that might assist in understanding, and ALL behaviors etc. that apply to the ghosts
in Pac-Man.
First off we have to understand how each ghost works and their attack pattern.
= = = ATTACK WAVES/PATTERNS = = =
In Pac-Man there are attack modes/waves which the ghosts follow regardless of level.
- - - Modes - - -
The Ghosts have two modes: attack and scatter modes. Generally the start of either mode will
be signaled by the Ghosts all reversing direction within a couple of moments between each other.
- Attack -
The Attack mode refers to when the ghosts are actively attempting to collide/kill Pac-Man.
- Scatter -
The Scatter mode refers to when the ghosts are not chasing after/attempting to kill Pac-Man although Blinky may still occasionally 
ignore the scatter mode and continue following Pac-Man.
- Prey Mode -
Prey mode is initiated by Pac-Man eating a power pill which will make the ghosts turn blue and try to get away from Pac-Man 
regardless of their personalities and the ghosts will move more slowly while in Prey mode as well. This is the only mode that when it 
is ended/changed to another mode that the ghosts will not reverse direction. Prey mode also pauses the scatter or attack timer and 
when Prey ends the ghosts enter the mode they were in before going into Prey mode.
- - - Waves - - -
The ghosts go in waves of attack and scatter modes based soley on a timer and nothing Pac-Man does.
- Waves Timing -
The attack modes are all 20 seconds long with the exception of the last attack wave which is infinite and will not end until 
either Pac-Man dies and loses a life upon which the wave timer will reset and the waves will begin again or when Pac-Man 
successfully collects all of the pellets and power pellets. Scatter mode is the first mode in which the ghosts start in once 
leaving their "base". The first scatter mode/phase (when the ghosts leave their base) is 7 seconds long which leads into a 20 
second attack phase which then leads into another 7 second scatter phase which then leads into another 20 second attack phase
which then leads into a 5 second scatter phase then into another 20 second attack phase which will again lead into another
5 second attack phase and then finally leads into an infinite attack phase.
Here is a chart of Wave timing:

= = = PERSONALITIES = = = 
Each ghost has their own "personality" which I will sum up below:
- - - BLINKY - - -
Blinky is very interesting actually. Blinky begins moving at the exact same speed as all of the other ghosts, but he speeds up
after a certain amount of pellets have been eaten by Pac-Man and it also depends on which level as on different levels he will
speed up with less and less pellets eaten. He is also the main attacker of Pac-Man throughout the game, he is the only ghost that
will actually actively track Pac-Man's exact position and attempt to catch up with Pac-Man. 
Here is the chart of when he goes ito what I will call 'Sanic mode':

- - - Pinky - - -
Pinky moves at a set constant speed like Inky and Clyde. Pinky is usually the first ghost to reverse when switching modes and can be
a pretty consistent tell-tale of when scatter and attack waves are switching. Pinky generally goes counterclockwise around the
walls on the map and Pinky will move in Pac-Man's general direction.
- - - Inky - - -
Inky is pretty generic. He is very similar to Pinky, but doesn't reverse instantly upon the switching of modes. The only distinctive
qualities of Inky is that instead of going counterclockwise around walls like Pinky he will generally go clockwise around walls and is
the most unpredictable ghost in Pac-Man.
- - - Clyde - - -
Clyde is generally not a threat, he will often turn off away from Pac-Man if charged instead of moving towards Pac-Man making
Clyde unpredictable in some ways, because if he doesn't turn off it usually means a quick death.
Explain with code, how you will keep ghosts from moving through walls
