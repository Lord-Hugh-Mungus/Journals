I was unable to sucessfully complete the game by that date.

The reason was due to some poor planning on my front and "doing that thing you said not do" by working with a partner....

I should have realized how much time it was actually going to take and put some work into it after school as well,
my ambitions got the better of me. Had I done around 30 minutes of work each night along with what I had done in class
I would've finished it on time easily.
