Coding wise I learned that it is much easier to break sections of code down into their own seperate areas allowing one to understand how each piece of code connects with each other.
For example: the code called for a function that looked for the button to be pressed when the red LED was on. Once pressed it would reduce the delay of the lights and thus increase
the difficulty with each successful button press.
I learned that you must be patient on the protyping process and that waiting until the last moment is sure to backfire as I saw with multiple of my peers. Our prototype transfered to
PCB really easily. The significant change was that we were able to chain all of our grounds together on PCB where on prototype we could not.
