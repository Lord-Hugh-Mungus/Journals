A method is a collection of statements that are put together to perform an operation.

	A method:
student nerd = new student();
nerd.setName("Nerdy");
nerd.getName();
This is an example of a method.

Return types are things that return values of a variable that has been set.
For example:
String getName(){  //Notice - String describes what we are returning
  return this.name;
  // This is "returning" a value to where it's called it's not actually printing
  //
}
To pass values to a method it would be something like this: 
int variable(int num goes here) {
It would tell the method which number it uses so if it was 5 the method would pick up the number 5
}
