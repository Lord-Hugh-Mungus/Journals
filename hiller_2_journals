On thursday and friday I found some new code and somewhat understood it
for my tic tac toe game.

Monday through Wednesday will be spent understanding the code and thursday
and friday will likely be spent create music from piezos for the game and  
winning and losing sounds for it.

This week I was able to come up with a concept regarding how I am going to build on the physical layer and will continue working on the weekend.
On monday I May have wasted a bit of time messing with dirtycow (ON a virtual machine of course)
On tuesday I did a bit of work and planned out how it would look on the physical layer
On wednesday I tried editing the code, I failed
On thursday I was able to recieve a arduino from you and did work that night and was able to kind of figure out exactly how it should be created
Today is friday and I haven't started anything yet.... (5 minutes into class.)


I will make my project visually appealing by getting cardboard and creating a frame for my project so someone can't see the wiring

When I connect a battery will likely be this coming tuesday or wednesday.
