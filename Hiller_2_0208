1. Having read the rubric I am going to make Galaga for my art, maybe create my own custom moon in the background.
I am also considering creating custom colors for the player ship instead of the original white and red.
2. Five methods I am going to end up making will be the moon, stars, player ship, enemies, and a background of some sort along with
creating a method to show lives in one corner.
3. I might add a for loop like this:  
        for (int i = 0; i < 60; i++) {
            gc.setFill(Color.PURPLE);
            gc.fillRect(rand1.nextInt(1500), rand1.nextInt(1000), 5, 5);
        }
That would be how I create my stars.
4. I will add a random to my code like how I did in my for loop by pushing the random value to an int so it could be used by the double
values of javaFX shapes. To create the random: Random rand1 = new Random();
5.I could add an if statement to check that when stars are at 60 or 59 I create an asteroid field or a moon.
          if (stars.equals 60){
              moon(gc);
          }
