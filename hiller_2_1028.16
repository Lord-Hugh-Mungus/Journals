This week I was able to come up with a concept regarding how I am going to build on the physical layer and will continue working on the weekend.
On monday I May have wasted a bit of time messing with dirtycow (ON a virtual machine of course)
On tuesday I did a bit of work and planned out how it would look on the physical layer
On wednesday I tried editing the code, I failed
On thursday I was able to recieve a arduino from you and did work that night and was able to kind of figure out exactly how it should be created
Today is friday and I haven't started anything yet.... (5 minutes into class.)


I will make my project visually appealing by getting cardboard and creating a frame for my project so someone can't see the wiring

When I connect a battery will likely be this coming tuesday or wednesday.
