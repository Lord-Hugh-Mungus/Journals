A string is text in programming, essentially if I wanted to put out a sentence I would be using a string.
An integer is a number in programming. Any number that is whole that you can think of is an integer.
A method is a set of code that can be called at any point during the program after it has been made.
We use methods so we don't have to make the same set of code over and over so that we can use one set of code for a lot of things.
