What is a Java class?
A Java class is kind of like a blueprint or container which is able to hold things within it, aka code, values, methods, etc.
What might a Java class be for JavaFX?
A Java Class for JavaFX would be something like:
public class square{
void drawSquare(){
fillRect(10,10,10);
}
}
What might be a method for class? 
A method for a class is literally the void I put inside the class above:
void drawSquare(){
fillRect(10,10,10);
}
