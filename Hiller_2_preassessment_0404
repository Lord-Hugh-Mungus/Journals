For each of the following provide 1.) a definition in complete sentences and 
2.) a specific ACTUAL code example from your game
= = = Integer = = =
Definition: Any number such as 1,2,3.... and so on.
Generally we can define integers to letters or full words (strings) by doing the following:
int a = 0;

This sets the letter a to the value 0 and that can be manipulated by other code.

An example piece of code from my game would be: 
int score = 0;

This piece of code is responsible for setting my starting score and then accepting any 
input to change it from other code in my game.

= = = Counter = = =
Definition: A counter is an integer that "counts" up or down using integers.
Counters can be used to measure time (an obvious implementation) or to count how many times something has occured,
e.g. tracking score based on how many enemies killed or items collected.
A simple Counter can be shown below:
static int i = 0;
//Static int i is created here so the void below can use it and keep in mind i is an integer
public void countup(){
int i++;
//int i++ counts up forever. All it says here is to add 1 to i. We would have to call the void countup() of course to
//use the counter of course.
}


An example piece of code from my game would be:
for (int i = 0; i < entities.size(); i++) {
                Entity entity = (Entity) entities.get(i);
                entity.draw(g);
}
Entity is an image in my game or rather a list of images. What it is checking for is if my integer i is smaller 
than/less than the size of my entities on screen then it should increase by one until it is of equal size and 
when that occurs it will go ahead and put my entities on screen.

= = = Class = = =
Definition: A class is literally a placeholder/template for creating different objects in java. Objects have the
Definition(cont.): properties defined by their classes.

= = = Object = = =

= = = Instance = = =

= = = ArrayList = = =

= = = Declaration = = =

= = = Initialization = = =

= = = Boolean = = =

= = = For loop = = =
