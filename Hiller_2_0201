Abstraction is the ability to articulate ideas that may not be physically tangible. 
A great example of this from your class is when we made the pseudocode on paper.
We showed how we had a general idea of how to create our code for our games, but it wasn't exactly physically attainable.
Most of the pseudocode was incorrect but showed how our ideas were abstracted and put into some code that related to our ideas.
When we explained how to make a projectile weapon for our character in our game, we used pseudocode with some explanation in
writing to do so, we took ideas and broke it down into something usable, that is abstraction in my opinion.
If you fail at abstract ideas/abstraction the quizzes definitely would have shown that as any pseudocode one made would have been
poorly made with a bad explanation and a bad general leading idea.
